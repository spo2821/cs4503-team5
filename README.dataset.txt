![Parking Lot Dataset](https://i.imgur.com/Hnda0gD.png)

The PKLot dataset contains 12,416 images of parking lots extracted from surveilance camera frames. There are images on sunny, cloudy, and rainy days and the parking spaces are labeled as occupied or empty. We have converted the original annotations to a variety of standard object detection formats by enclosing a bounding box around the original dataset's rotated rectangle annotations.
